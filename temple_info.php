					<p><strong>Shree Ganesh</strong> is the first to be worshipped before beginning any new project or venture as he is the destroyer of obstacles (Vighnaharta). This is Shree Siddhivinayak Ganapati Temple at Prabhadevi in Mumbai, a two-century-old Temple that fulfills the desires of the worshipers.</p>
					<p>The city of Mumbai is a mute witness to places of worship & historical interest, which are not only popular but also of archaeological importance.</p>
					<p>Arguably the most popular & significant places of worship are the Shree Siddhivinayak Ganapati Mandir situated at Prabhadevi. This temple was first consecrated on Thursday 19th November 1801, a fact that is noted in government records. </p>
					<p>The temple then was a small structure housing the black stone idol of Shree Siddhivinayak, which was two and half feet wide. The outstanding feature of this deity is the tilt of the trunk to the right side.</p>

				<p>A Hindu temple begins with the foundation and continues in height up to the Kalash (pinnacle). The Kalash is a pointed dome at the top and is of religious significance. The Kalash, which adorned the earlier temple was lowered with proper rituals and is now kept as an exhibit within the temple premises. The temple as it stand now has been constructed after deliberations with experts on Hindu religion and customs so as to maintain the sanctity of the idol as per the Hindu Shastras. The idol of Shree Siddhivinayak has not been touched in the process of rebuilding the temple.</p>
				<p>So as to ensure that there is no human transgression or trespass in the area from the point at which the idol is situated in to the up to the Kalash, which is a pointed dome of 12 feet high Gabhara (sanctum sanctorum) weighing 1500Kgs. and plated in gold. The devotees can thus earn the satisfaction of seeking the blessing of Shree Siddhivinayak by taking a devoted look at the Kalash. </p>
